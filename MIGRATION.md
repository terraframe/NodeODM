# Migration Guide

## From API version 2.1.1 to 2.1.2

 * Minor breaking change: `help` strings from `/options` no longer substitute `%(default)s` and `%(choices)s` variables. Clients should do that by replacing the `default` and `domain` attributes before displaying them to the user. This is necessary for better localization support.

## From API version 1.x to 2.x

 * `skipPostProcessing` parameter in `/task/new` and `/task/new/init` no longer processes 2D tiles via gdal2tiles.py. So the `orthophoto_tiles`, `dsm_tiles` and `dtm_tiles` directories are no longer being generated by NodeODM. Engines can provide such folders if needed and will be included in the output archive. With ODM you can now use the `--tiles` parameter to generate the tiles.
 * `/task/<uuid>/download/orthophoto.tif` has been removed. One can extract the `orthophoto.tif` file from the `all.zip` archive (via `/task/<uuid>/download/all.zip`).
